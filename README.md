# Project Name: Poll-It, Voting System

### Project Description
#### Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, in a group, or in a company, there are different opinions about a project, a position, a candidate or a travel location, watching different movies, etc. Everyone wants their opinions to be respected, so a transparent and fair vote is needed at such times. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An online voting system website. Administrators can add voters to the database, and the added voter can through the login page to enter the website, they can vote at any time and any place. Multiple elections can coexist. Administrators can create polls and choose electors or things to elect and check the number of votes in real time. Administrators also can view registrants, manage databases, and view election votes and records. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team hopes that through this voting system, everyone has the same opportunity to choose what they want or express their thoughts.

#### Technologies

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT to build the front-end webpage of the voting system. We try to use the diversity of CSS and JAVASCRIPT to beautify the webpage. We hope that the administrator can add an avatar to the account when adding an account to facilitate identification. We utilize PHP and MYSQL to build the backend of the voting system, keeping the database stored and updated.

### Why Did You Pick This Project?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We chose to create a Voting/poll system since it would allow you to ask a question to an audience and be able to see how your users felt about a certain question or statement. For example, you could create a poll/voting system which asks an audience if they like Java or Python more, using the poll system you are able to quickly see what percentage of your audience prefers one language over the other,and our Voting system can be implemented to fit all cases.
